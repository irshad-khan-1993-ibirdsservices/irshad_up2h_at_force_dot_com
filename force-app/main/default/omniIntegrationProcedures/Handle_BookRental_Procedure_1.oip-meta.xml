            &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Siddhartha is a novel by Hermann Hesse that deals with the spiritual journey of a boy known as Siddhartha from the Indian subcontinent during the time of Lord Buddha. In a very simple prose, Hesse has conveyed a very profound message for all seekers. A brahmin boy follows his heart and goes through various lives to finally understand what it means to be enlightened. He experiences life as a pious brahmin, a Samana, a rich merchant, a lover and an ordinary ferryman, to a father. Neither a practitioner nor a devotee, neither meditating nor reciting, Siddhartha comes to blend in with the world, resonating with the rhythms of nature, bending the reader&apos;s ear down to hear answers from the river.&quot;,
